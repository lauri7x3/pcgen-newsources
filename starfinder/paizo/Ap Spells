Viral Destruction							TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:Necromancy																	CASTTIME:1 reaction			RANGE:close [25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels]					TARGETAREA:one newly dead creature; see text																											DURATION:Instantaneous; see text											SAVEINFO:Will negates, see text							SPELLRES:Yes					SOURCEPAGE:Starfinder #2:Temple of the Twelve pg. 51	DESC:You can cast this spell only immediately after a creature in range dies. On its next turn in the initiative order, the corpse stands up [if applicable; this does not require a move action], can take a single move action to move up to its speed, and makes a single attack using the weapons and bonuses it had when alive [though it can’t use class features, spell-like abilities, or spells]. You can choose the target of the affected creature’s attack or allow the target corpse to select a target entirely at random. If the target of this spell was friendly or helpful toward you in life, the spell works automatically; otherwise, the corpse can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this spell, as if the creature were still alive.After making its attack, the creature that you have targeted with viral destruction falls and is dead as normal. However, if this attack kills the affected creature’s target or if it knocks it unconscious, that target must succeed at a Will saving throw [using the spell’s DC] or be subject to viral destruction and make a single attack on its next turn before returning to its normal dead or unconscious state. If the secondary target of viral destruction is merely unconscious and becomes conscious again before its next action, that creature is freed from the viral destruction effect and the spell ends. Each attack caused by this spell can transfer the viral destruction effect to its target if that target is knocked unconscious or killed by the attack, until the spell has affected a number of creatures equal to your mystic level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The spell fails without expending a spell slot if the target isn’t asleep or in a resting state similar to sleep. If you’ve never met the target in person and lack a material connection to the target, the target gains a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the spell works, the target remains resting for 1 minute, then has a nightmare, rouses, and becomes frightened for 2d6 rounds. The target can’t willingly reenter the affected resting state for 1 hour. To do so after this time has elapsed, the target must succeed at the saving throw again. If this save fails, the target can try again once per hour thereafter. After 24 hours have passed, this restless state ends. |!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness [reduced to concealment against creatures that have darkvision]. Your body and gear are incorporeal, but you can’t fly or pass through solid objects or creatures, and your gear can’t be removed from you or used by anyone. You can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical surfaces and liquids, and difficult terrain doesn’t slow you. However, you can’t attack physically or manipulate objects. You can speak, cast spells that require no items to cast, and perform mental actions.

Umbral Tendrils								TYPE:Spell					SCHOOL:illusion [shadow]																	CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:medium [100 ft. + 10 ft./level]					TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius spread																											DURATION:1 round + 1 round/3 levels [D]											SAVEINFO:Will half, see text							SPELLRES:Yes					SOURCEPAGE:Starfinder #12:Heart of Night pg. 53	DESC:You summon a vision of a writhing mass of shadowy tendrils to assault creatures within 10 feet of the ground in the area. This area is difficult terrain. The first time a creature enters the area [including when the effect appears] on its turn, and each round the creature remains there, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and becomes entangled. If the tendrils are in dim light or darkness, the DC of the Will save increases by 2. A creature that succeeds at a Will saving throw halves the damage it takes and avoids becoming entangled. The same casting of this spell can’t render such a creature entangled again. By succeeding at subsequent saves, such a creature reduces damage it takes from the same casting of the spell to one-quarter normal.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

In addition, the weapon has the nauseate critical hit effect.The biotic taclash functions only for you, and once you create it, you can neither drop it nor be disarmed of it. As a move action, you can stow the biotic taclash, causing its component nanites to discorporate into individual nanobots that disperse over your body but remain while the spell lasts. During that time, you can cause the nanites to reincorporate to form the weapon again by taking another move action.As a reaction when you strike a target with the biotic taclash, you can dismiss the spell to cause the weapon to discorporate into its component nanites, which then swarm over the target.
